# The purpose of this Portfolio:
When I had the idea of building this Portfolio I invisioned it to serve as CV to show my abilities as a Front-End Developer.

# Why React?
I had prior experience in Angular, but I always wanted to learn React and seing the market movements and React being the number 1 most used Front-End framework I decided to build the project with it. I found it easier to understand than Angular.

# Installation and Requirements: 
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages, hence you don't need to install it locally, but if you want to do it I'll guide you.

## Requirements:
- Node installed
- VSCode installed

## Installation Process:
1. The first step to it is decide which IDE you will use, I would sugest you to use VSCode.
VSCode extensions to help the coding process: 
- ES7 React/Redux/React-Native snippets.

2. Create a empty Folder in your computer and name it as you want.
3. Go to the this repo, click the Code button above it and copy the link to clone it locally.
4. Open the folder you created on VSCode, then click the terminal option, on the top of the page, and click New Terminal.
5. On the terminal, make sure you're in the correct path, after that write `git clone` and paste the URL you copied on the step 3.
6. Now you will be able to see the code from the repo in your VSCode.
7. Before starting it you will need to run `npm install` on the terminal to install all the dependecies that I use in this project. Make sure you're in the correct path, run the command inside the project folder.
8. If followed all the steps, you just need to run `npm start` to open the project locally, it probably will open on `http://localhost:3000`.
